          My name is Matthew Lee and I studied a BE(Hons) (Biomedical
          Engineering)/BSc (Computer Science, Psychology) degree at the
          University of Auckland.
        </p>
        <p className="mt-4">
          My studies in Engineering taught me a lot of computational software
          skills, such as solving complex problems using various languages. I
          feel this was a good complement to the software skills I&#39;ve learnt
          from my Computer Science degree, where I&#39;ve learnt more abstract
          concepts such as basics of algorithms, ADT&#39;s, and I/O skills.
          Together, I&#39;ve become proficient in MATLAB, Java, Javascript,
          C++, Python, R, LabView, ARDUINO, and HTML.
        </p>
        <p className="mt-4">
          I also spent my last summer working for Allsite.AI, a small startup
          specialising in creating a generative AI to speed up the site
          development process. In this role I worked primarily in Python, with
          some time spent in C++. I also had the opportunity to gain a number of
          soft skills, such as how to work effectively as part of a team with an
          agile development style. I found that although I had more than enough
          technical knowledge for the role, I learnt lots about things that
          University brushed over, such as management programs like Jira, DevOps
          processes, and Git. With the combination of hard skills I got from
          uni, and the slightly more abstract, but equally important skills I
          picked up in this role, I feel confident in my abilities to excel in a 
          formal role as part of a team.

          Outside of my studies, I&#39;ve found that my personal interests have
          led me to roles and work that have provided me with valuable experience
          I will use to benefit your workplace. Alongside being Club Captain of
          the Snowsports Club, I founded the Surf Club. As Club Captain of the
          Snowsports club I&#39;m in charge of organising events for our 600+
          members, while the surf club I founded already has over 100 members.

          Please take a look at my Github, as I believe it showcases my strong
          sense of discipline and desire to learn, as I&#39;ve taught myself
          full-stack web development over the course of the last month. With
          this process I&#39;ve created two websites, one for a magic-mirror
          project I&#39;m working on, and another for a personal portfolio,
          which you&#39;re looking at right now (so please forgive me if it&#39;s not
          completely polished as it&#39;s still a WIP)
        </p>

          As you can see, when I&#39;m passionate about an activity, I am
          willing to work hard towards it. Thank you for taking the time to read this,
          and please don&#39;t hesitate to get in touch if you think I&#39;d be a good fit 
          for your team
